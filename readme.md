# Low Author

An ExpressionEngine add-on to save an entry's author's screen name as a searchable channel field.

## Compatibility & Requirements

Low Author is compatible with **EE 2.4+**.

## Installation

- Download and unzip;
- Copy the `low_author` folder to your `system/expressionengine/third_party` directory;
- In your Control Panel, go to Add-Ons &rarr; Fieldtypes and click the Install-link in the Low Author row;
- All set!

## Usage

Once installed, you can create a Low Author field to your channels. The field will show as a disabled text input and will contain the screen name of the author, or blank if it's a new entry.

Adding a Low Author field to an existing channel will auto-populate the field for existing entries.
